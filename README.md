In recent times, an interest in the use of the bent crystals for the high-energy particle beam collimation and extraction has increased. A significant contribution to the technological progress of the development and installation such crystals at accelerators was made by the UA9 collaboration. So far an experimental work is carried out for the characterization of the crystals, their production and use on such accelerators as SPS or LHC at CERN. Nevertheless, before using the crystal for its intended purpose, it must be checked: determine the angle of the deflection, the efficiency of the channeling etc. Such tests are conducted at H8 SPS extraction beam line.

One of the important characteristics of the crystal is the probability of the inelastic nuclear interactions (INI) and its dependence on the crystal orientation with respect to the beam direction. To register the INI happening in the crystal a couple of plastic scintillators (10 × 25 × 5 mm3 ) is used in coincidences mode. For more effective INI events registration the position of the detectors should be symmetrical with respect to the center of the beam. 

Until 2017 the UA9 collaboration manually installed the plastic scintillators on the beam, each time interrupting the operation of the extraction line. This regime of the work was laborious and took a lot of experimental time. Thus, it was decided to create motorized linear platforms for moving the plastic scintillators with the possibility of remote control. In this case, physicists would not have to stop the work of the extraction line, and also remotely carry out calibration and alignment of the detectors with respect to the beam direction.
